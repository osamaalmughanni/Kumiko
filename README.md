# What is Kumiko?
Kumiko is similar to the traditional Dynamo Player, as it enables you to execute your Dynamo scripts within Revit files. However, it goes beyond standard functionalities by offering enhanced portability, Git-based collaboration, and seamless script sharing among team members.

# Usage

## 3 — Organise Your Scripts

### 3.1 Folder Structure

By default, the recommended location for storing your Dynamo scripts is located at:
```
%USERPROFILE%\Kumiko
```
*You can also navigate to the root folder by clicking on the Kumiko logo in the sidebar.*

Dynamo scripts must be grouped within folders, with the folder name providing a description of the script's purpose. Here's an illustrative example of how you can organize your Dynamo scripts within the root directory.

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Export Room Areas
  │     └── 📄 script.dyn
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     └── 📄 script.dyn
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
        └── 📄 script.dyn
```

### 3.2 Playlists

You can also include multiple scripts within a folder if you want to run them sequentially as a Playlist:

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Export Room Areas
  │     ├── 📄 01-removeUnplaced.dyn
  │     └── 📄 02-saveToExcel.dyn
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     ├── 📄 01-renameViews.dyn
  │     └── 📄 02-createFloorPlans.dyn
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
        ├── 📄 01-adaptBoundingBox.dyn
        └── 📄 02-generateViews.dyn
```

When running multiple scripts, the execution order will depend on the alphabetical order. So, make sure to keep that in mind while organizing your scripts.

### 3.3 Metadata (Optional)

Additionally, you can include a `script.json` file to provide additional information about the script.

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Export Room Areas
  │   ├── 📄 01-removeUnplaced.dyn
  │   ├── 📄 02-saveToExcel.dyn
  │   └── 📝 script.json
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │   ├── 📄 01-renameViews.dyn
  │   ├── 📄 02-createFloorPlans.dyn
  │   └── 📝 script.json
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
      ├── 📄 01-adaptBoundingBox.dyn
      ├── 📄 02-generateViews.dyn
      └── 📝 script.json
```

Here is a sample content of the `script.json` file:

```json
{
   "title":"Export Room Areas",
   "description":"Removes all unplaced rooms and saves all room areas to an excel file.",
   "author":"John Doe",
   "compatibility":"Revit 2022-2023",
   "dependencies":[
      "Clockwork",
      "BimorphNodes"
   ],
   "documentation":"https://github.com/johndoe/dynamo/blob/main/scripts/export_room_areas.md",
   "notes":"Please ensure you have the required packages installed: Clockwork and BimorphNodes."
}
```

The content of the `script.json` file will be displayed as badges inside Kumiko.

## 4 — Publish Your Scripts

Once you have successfully organized all your scripts, you can make them accessible by clicking on the synchronization symbol located in the sidebar. Once the symbol changes to green, your scripts will become ready to be accessed or shared.

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/Kumiko/assets/49910802/830adc35-599f-474f-98b8-e6e86a9b8137

*After synchronizing your content, your scripts will be ready to run within Revit. Simply hover the mouse over the script and click the Play button.*

## 5 — Connect to Repository (Optional)

Connecting your content to a remote Git repository offers various benefits, including convenient access, collaboration with others, and efficient tracking of modifications.

To interact with your repository using Kumiko, please follow these steps:

### 5.1 Install Git

1. Visit the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Download the installer for Windows.
3. Run the downloaded installer.
4. Follow the installation instructions, sticking to the default settings unless you have specific preferences.
5. Complete the installation process.

### 5.2 Edit Configuration File

1. Close Kumiko.
2. Locate the `config.json` file at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kumiko`.
3. Open the file in a text editor.
4. Find the `gitUrl` key and replace its value with the URL of your Git repository.
5. Save the changes.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "C:\\Users\\John\\Kumiko",
  "gitUrl": "https://github.com/johndoe/dynamo.git",
  "windowWidth": 380.0,
  "windowHeight": 990.0,
  "windowTopPosition": 247.0,
  "windowLeftPosition": 1932.0,
  "windowTopMost": true
}
```

Now, Kumiko will automatically fetch and apply content changes to the designated Git repository during synchronization.

### 5.3 Git Authentication

When synchronizing, you may be prompted to authenticate your Git credentials. Make sure to follow the provided authentication process or instructions to securely verify your Git credentials and enable any interaction between Kumiko and the Git repository.

## 6 — Manage Team Members

If you are a BIM Manager within an organization or company, there might be a need to share your scripts with other team members while maintaining control over their access to the content. In such circumstances, you have the option to grant other Members the ability to instantly access your latest content upon synchronising.

### 6.1 Add Team Members to all Resources

To share all your scripts with specific team members, click on the "Team" page in the sidebar and follow the steps demonstrated in this video.

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/Kumiko/assets/49910802/61e97b67-8685-41a7-a2e4-14662d741faf

*By leaving the resource input empty, you will be sharing all of your content with that particular user.*

### 6.2 Add Team Members to Specific Resources

To control which resources team members can access, you must first organize your scripts using a more structured approach. Start by creating a main folder for each project or category and put the relevant scripts inside. This way, you can assign team members to specific projects, allowing them access only to the resources within their assigned project.

Here's an example on how organize your scripts based on projects:

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Project A
  │     ├── 📁 Export Room Areas
  │     │     ├── 📄 01-removeUnplaced.dyn
  │     │     └── 📄 02-saveToExcel.dyn
  │     ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     │     ├── 📄 01-renameViews.dyn
  │     │     └── 📄 02-createFloorPlans.dyn
  │     └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
  │           ├── 📄 01-adaptBoundingBox.dyn
  │           └── 📄 02-generateViews.dyn
  ├── 📁 Project B
  │     ├── .
  │     └── .
  └── 📁 Project C
        ├── .
        └── .
```

In this case, you can add a team member to the resource `Project A` and share only the scripts within that folder.

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/Kumiko/assets/49910802/2c09f7f2-6479-4698-8252-3604e5a8e5fc

You can also be more specific by using a forward slash. For example: `Project A/Export Room Areas.`

## 7 — Shared Scripts

On the `Shared` page, you can access all the scripts shared with you by others. As soon as another user adds you to their team, you will gain immediate access. Any changes made by users will be applied and visible to you simultaneously.

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/Kumiko/assets/49910802/334f4e2f-b6ac-4c17-b793-2d9c50e80051

*Sharing of scripts is restricted to verified users with an active subscription. To determine the script owner, simply hover over the email icon.*

## 8 — Featured Scripts

With Kumiko, we strive to share high-quality and dependency-free scripts within our community. You can explore our featured scripts by visiting the Featured page and give them a try. If you would like to feature one of your scripts with Kumiko, please get in touch with us via email.
