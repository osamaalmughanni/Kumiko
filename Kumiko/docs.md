# Overview
Kumiko is similar to the traditional Dynamo Player, as it allows you to run your Dynamo scripts. However, it surpasses standard functionalities by providing enhanced portability, a version-controlled collaboration with git and easy script sharing with other members.

## Requirements
The app is designed to operate exclusively on Windows-based computers. It has been developed as a single executable (exe) file, meaning that it encompasses all the necessary code and resources for execution. Here are some key requirements:

- Windows 10 or greater
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or greater
- Revit 2013.1 or greater
- git (Optional)

---

# Getting Started

## 1 Get the latest version

Download the latest version of Kumiko from [getkumiko.com](https://www.getkumiko.com), close all active Revit applications, and ensure that no Revit processes are running. Run the downloaded Kumiko.exe file and proceed with the verification process.

After running, Kumiko will detect any Revit version (2023.1 or later) and automatically install the necessary .dll and .addin files for you.

## 2 Verify your identity

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/docs/assets/49910802/deeaad56-3074-4c62-b75f-c6eadb8677ac

Enter your email to verify your identity. After logging in, check your email for a verification code. Remember to check your junk mail folder if you don't recieve the email. The code will expire after 10 minutes. Enter or paste the code to access your account.

# 3 Add your first scripts

## 3.1 Understand Kumiko's folder structure

By default, the recommended location for storing your Dynamo scripts is located at:
```
%USERPROFILE%\Kumiko
```

Dynamo scripts are grouped within folders, with the folder name providing a description of the script's purpose, while the file name holds less significance. Here's an illustrative example of how you can effectively organize your Dynamo scripts within the root directory.

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Extract Room Areas
  │     └── 📄 script.dyn
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     └── 📄 script.dyn
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
        └── 📄 script.dyn
```

### 3.1.1 Playlists

You can also include multiple scripts within a folder if you want to run them sequentially:

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Extract Room Areas
  │     ├── 📄 updateValues.dyn
  │     └── 📄 saveToExcel.dyn
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     ├── 📄 renameViews.dyn
  │     └── 📄 createFloorPlans.dyn
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
        ├── 📄 adaptBoundingBox.dyn
        └── 📄 generateViews.dyn
```

### 3.1.2 Script Documentation

Additionally, you can include a `script.json` file to provide additional information about the script.

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Extract Room Areas
  │   ├── 📄 updateValues.dyn
  │   ├── 📄 saveToExcel.dyn
  │   └── 📄 script.json
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │   ├── 📄 renameViews.dyn
  │   ├── 📄 createFloorPlans.dyn
  │   └── 📄 script.json
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
      ├── 📄 adaptBoundingBox.dyn
      ├── 📄 generateViews.dyn
      └── 📄 script.json
```

This is an example of how such a file might look like.

```json
{
   "title":"Export data as .xlsx",
   "description":"Export an active open schedule with element IDs from Revit to Excel, facilitating data analysis and manipulation outside of Revit.",
   "author":"Osama Almughanni",
   "compatibility":"Revit 2022-2023",
   "dependencies":[
      "Clockwork",
      "BimorphNodes"
   ],
   "documentation":"https://example.com/script-documentation",
   "video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd6U2KgHI6k",
   "notes":"Please ensure you have the required packages installed: Clockwork and BimorphNodes."
}
```

### 3.1.3 Sync your scripts

### 3.1.4 Run your first script

# 4 Connecting to your remote Git repository

## 4.1 Edit the configuration file

To personalize Kumiko's behavior and adapt it to your specific needs and preferences, you can make changes to the `config.json` file.

1. Close Kumiko to ensure that any modifications can take effect.
2. Locate the `config.json` file in the following directory:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kumiko
```

3. Open the config.json file using a text editor of your choice.

Inside the config.json file, you will find various settings that you can customize. Here is an example of the file's structure:

```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "C:\\Users\\[username]\\Kumiko",
  "gitUrl": "https://github.com/[username]/[repo].git",
  "windowWidth": 380.0,
  "windowHeight": 990.0,
  "windowTopPosition": 247.0,
  "windowLeftPosition": 1932.0,
  "windowTopMost": true
}
```

Here is a brief explanation for each setting:

**rootDirectory**: Specifies the root directory where Kumiko will store its files and data. You can modify this path to a directory of your choice.

**gitUrl**: Specifies the URL of the Git repository that Kumiko will sync with. You can change this setting to sync Kumiko with your Git repository.

**windowWidth** and **windowHeight**: Determine the dimensions of Kumiko's application window. You can adjust these values to suit your screen size and personal preference.

**windowTopPosition** and **windowLeftPosition**: Control the position of Kumiko's window on your screen. You can modify these values to change its default placement.

**windowTopMost**: A boolean value that determines whether Kumiko's window will always stay on top of other windows. Set it to `true` if you want Kumiko's window to be topmost; otherwise, set it to `false`.

## 4.2 Git authentication

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/docs/assets/49910802/dfb060e5-15e3-436a-a298-0140d0f220c6

When working with Git, you may be prompted to authenticate your Git credentials. Make sure to follow the provided authentication process or instructions to securely verify your Git credentials and enable any interaction between Kumiko and the Git repository. This authentication step ensures the proper functioning and synchronization of data between Kumiko and your repository.
