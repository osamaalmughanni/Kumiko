# What is Kumiko?
Kumiko is similar to the traditional Dynamo Player, as it allows you to run your Dynamo scripts inside Revit files. However, it surpasses standard functionalities by providing enhanced portability, a version-controlled collaboration with git and easy script sharing with other members.

## Requirements
The app is designed to operate exclusively on Windows-based computers. It is developed as a single executable (exe) file, meaning that it encompasses all the necessary code and resources for execution. However, there are some key requirements that should be considered, these are:

- Windows 10 or greater
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or greater
- Revit 2013.1 or greater
- git (Optional)

# Getting Started

## • 1 Get the latest version

Download the latest version of Kumiko from [getkumiko.com](https://www.getkumiko.com), close all active Revit applications, and ensure that no Revit processes are running. Run the downloaded Kumiko.exe file and proceed with the verification process.

## • 2 Verify your identity

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/docs/assets/49910802/deeaad56-3074-4c62-b75f-c6eadb8677ac

First, enter your email to verify your identity. After logging in, check your email for the verification code. Remember to check your junk mail folder if you don't recieve any email. Enter or paste the code to access your account. The verification code will expire after 10 minutes.

## • 3 Organise your scripts

### 3.1 Kumiko's folder structure

By default, the recommended location for storing your Dynamo scripts is located at:
```
%USERPROFILE%\Kumiko
```
*You can also navigate to the root folder by clicking on the Kumiko logo in the sidebar.*

Dynamo scripts must be grouped within folders, with the folder name providing a description of the script's purpose. Here's an illustrative example of how you can organize your Dynamo scripts within the root directory.

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Extract Room Areas
  │     └── 📄 script.dyn
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     └── 📄 script.dyn
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
        └── 📄 script.dyn
```

### 3.2 Playlists

You can also include multiple scripts within a folder if you want to run them sequentially as a Playlist:

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Extract Room Areas
  │     ├── 📄 01-updateValues.dyn
  │     └── 📄 02-saveToExcel.dyn
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │     ├── 📄 01-renameViews.dyn
  │     └── 📄 02-createFloorPlans.dyn
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
        ├── 📄 01-adaptBoundingBox.dyn
        └── 📄 02-generateViews.dyn
```

When running multiple scripts, the execution order will be influenced by their alphabetical order. So, make sure to keep that in mind while organizing your scripts.

### 3.3 Document your script (Optional)

Additionally, you can include a `script.json` file to provide additional information about the script.

```
- 📁 Kumiko
  ├── 📁 Extract Room Areas
  │   ├── 📄 01-updateValues.dyn
  │   ├── 📄 02-saveToExcel.dyn
  │   └── 📝 script.json
  ├── 📁 Create Floor Plans
  │   ├── 📄 01-renameViews.dyn
  │   ├── 📄 02-createFloorPlans.dyn
  │   └── 📝 script.json
  └── 📁 Generate 3D Views
      ├── 📄 01-adaptBoundingBox.dyn
      ├── 📄 02-generateViews.dyn
      └── 📝 script.json
```

Here is a sample representation of the `script.json` file:

```json
{
   "title":"Export data as .xlsx",
   "description":"Export an active open schedule with element IDs from Revit to Excel, facilitating data analysis and manipulation outside of Revit.",
   "author":"John Doe",
   "compatibility":"Revit 2022-2023",
   "dependencies":[
      "Clockwork",
      "BimorphNodes"
   ],
   "documentation":"https://example.com/script-documentation",
   "video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd6U2KgHI6k",
   "notes":"Please ensure you have the required packages installed: Clockwork and BimorphNodes."
}
```

The content of the `script.json` file will be displayed as badges in the script card in Kumiko.

*Eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.*

## • 4 Publish your scripts

Once you have successfully organized all your scripts, you can make them accessible by clicking on the synchronization symbol located in the sidebar. Once the symbol changes to green, your scripts will become visible and ready to be accessed or shared.

## • 5 Connecting to Git repository

If you find yourself working from multiple workstations, it can be beneficial to keep your content synced with a remote repository. This enables easy access to your work, facilitates collaboration with other contributors during development, and allows you to track any modifications made.

### 5.1 Instal Git

Kumiko requires Git to be installed in order to interact with your repository.

To install the latest version of Git on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Download the installer for Windows.
3. Run the downloaded installer.
4. Follow the installation instructions, keeping the default settings unless you have specific preferences.
5. Complete the installation.

### 5.2 Edit the configuration file

To customize Kumiko's behavior, you can modify the `config.json` file.

1. Close Kumiko.
2. Locate the `config.json` file at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kumiko`.
3. Open the file in a text editor.
4. Find the `gitUrl` key and replace its value with the URL of your Git repository.
5. Save the changes.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "C:\\Users\\John\\Kumiko",
  "gitUrl": "https://github.com/johndoe/dynamo.git",
  "windowWidth": 380.0,
  "windowHeight": 990.0,
  "windowTopPosition": 247.0,
  "windowLeftPosition": 1932.0,
  "windowTopMost": true
}
```

Now, Kumiko will automatically push content changes to the specified Git repository during synchronization if the `gitUrl` value is provided.

### 5.3 Git authentication

When synchronizing, you may be prompted to authenticate your Git credentials. Make sure to follow the provided authentication process or instructions to securely verify your Git credentials and enable any interaction between Kumiko and the Git repository.

## • 6 Manage Team Members

If you are a BIM Manager within an organization or company, there might be a need to share your scripts with other team members while maintaining control over their access to the content. In such circumstances, you have the option to grant other Members the ability to execute specific scripts from specific resources or folders.

### 6.1 Add team members

To add Team members, click on the `team` page on the sidebar and follow the steps shown in this video

https://github.com/osamaalmughanni/docs/assets/49910802/dfb060e5-15e3-436a-a298-0140d0f220c6
